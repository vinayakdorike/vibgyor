Tree Monitoring Application Repository

### What's the problem?

As we know that trees are the true source which benefits us in many different ways such as they are used for cooking purposes, furniture, Paper generation and animal fodders etc.
Nowadays, people are cutting down trees just to satisfy their needs which is causing deforestation which in turn is causing many problems such as Air pollution, No rainfall, No homes for flying creatures etc. To overcome this, our government has declared an environment day to plant trees to an environment an eco -friendly.
As we see, most of the people plants trees on this days, but the problem is once they plant they may forget the maintain the growth of that plant such as how healthy the plant is, is it height is growing correctly, are they generating fruits etc. Due to lack of monitoring most of the plants do not grow and start diminishing due to lac of water and proper care. 


### How can technology help?

Technology can be used to keep people or entities aware about the conditions of the trees which are being planted in the surrounding so that trees will last longer and more and more healthy trees will be there in surrounding. Furthermore, it can also be used to constantly monitor trees in certain areas to stop illegal cutting of trees.
 
### The idea

Our goal is to locate any trees around your neighbourhood on geolocation. Through the web portal anyone can check the status of the tree nearby also they can check the health of the tree. One can register himself/herself on web browser while planting any plant from anywhere and can enrol the location as well for particular tree.

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Addition and storage of tree entries in database with details like Person/Entity who planted tree, location    and tree health.
- Fetch the location of tree when it is planted and mark this location on google map with actaual co-ordinates.
- QRCode to scan and get information of the tree.

Please refer our schedule for this project in Project RoadMap File in the documentation or Powerpoint Presentation.
